<h2>"Corn Yield Forecasting: A Supervised Learning Model for Sustainable Farming"</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> This project develops a Simple linear Regression model using supervised learning dataset to predict corn yield using inputs like land area, seed quantity, and fertilizer. It aims to deliver accurate yield forecasts, helping farmers optimize resource use and adopt sustainable farming practices. The insights gained will support informed decision-making, boosting both efficiency and productivity in corn production.
</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Imagine a farmer who owns a large corn farm. He's looking to develop a system to help him predict his corn yield based on various input factors. Specifically, he wants the system to analyze data such as the size of the land, the quantity of seeds planted, and the amount of fertilizer applied. By leveraging this data, the farmer hopes to build a predictive model that will estimate the corn yield for each season. Additionally, he aims for the system to provide guidance on the optimal amounts of land, seed, and fertilizer required to achieve the desired yield, helping him manage resources efficiently. </p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
1. Predict Corn Yield: Use fertilizer input data to predict corn yield, enabling better resource planning. <br>       
2. Optimize Resource Allocation:Provide insights into fertilizer requirements to achieve target yields, minimizing waste and supporting sustainability.
<h3>Data and Methodology</h3>
The dataset includes two key variables:
1. Fertilizer Used: Amount of fertilizer applied.
2. Corn Yield:Yield produced in response to fertilizer application.<br>
